Target: A fully functional render process.

## Now

It can render and output a simple [image](./outputs/gradient_color.bmp).

Run `main.cpp` to show this example.

Use third-party libraries [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) to provide math support.

## Need some Helps

I don't known how to use multi source file in cmake, so I put all methods into a big header file.

When I use multi source file in cmake, it always throws errors: `undefined reference to function`, and I tried some fixing methods on the internet, but all of them didn't work.

If someone know how to fix this problem, please contect me at `QQ: 1275935966` or `email: 1275935966@qq.com`
